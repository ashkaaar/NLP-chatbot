The `main.py` file serves as the core logic for the AI chatbot. It imports necessary libraries and modules from the openfabric_pysdk and Transformers libraries. 

The chatbot utilizes a pre-trained DialoGPT model fine-tuned specifically for science-related inquiries. This fine-tuning process ensures that the model is optimized to generate contextually relevant responses to science-related questions. 

The `execute` function, called on each execution pass, takes user input, processes it using the fine-tuned model, and generates a response tailored to science education. 

The chatbot leverages techniques such as tokenization and generation to ensure accurate and comprehensive answers.
