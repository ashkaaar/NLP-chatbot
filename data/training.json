        "Supramolecular chemistry is the study of non-covalent interactions between molecules and the assembly of molecular complexes or aggregates through these interactions. It focuses on the design and synthesis of molecular structures that exhibit emergent properties and functions resulting from the collective behavior of multiple molecular components, such as host-guest complexes, self-assembled monolayers, and molecular machines.",

        "Examples include hydrogen-bonded networks, coordination polymers, and self-assembled nanoparticles, which have applications in materials science (e.g., molecular sensors, nanomaterials, drug delivery systems) and biology (e.g., protein folding, enzyme catalysis, biomolecular recognition). Supramolecular chemistry also underlies natural phenomena such as molecular recognition in biological systems and self-assembly processes in living organisms."

Unlike classical computers, which encode information in binary bits (0 or 1), quantum computers exploit the unique properties of qubits to represent and manipulate information in multiple states simultaneously, enabling exponential speedup for certain types of calculations.",

        "Challenges include qubit decoherence (loss of quantum coherence), which can degrade computation accuracy and result in errors, as well as the difficulty of scaling up quantum systems to large numbers of qubits while maintaining coherence and controlling quantum interactions. Additionally, quantum algorithms and error correction codes are still in development, and practical applications of quantum computing remain limited."

        "QCD explains the properties of strongly interacting particles, such as baryons (e.g., protons, neutrons) and mesons (e.g., pions, kaons), in terms of color charge, color confinement, and asymptotic freedom. It predicts the existence of exotic particles such as glueballs and hybrids, which consist of gluons and quarks bound by the strong force."

        "Acids are substances that release hydrogen ions (H+) in aqueous solutions, while bases are substances that release hydroxide ions (OH-) or accept hydrogen ions. They are characterized by their pH levels and chemical properties."
    ],
    [
        "Describe pH Scale.",
        "pH Scale is a measure of the acidity or basicity of a solution, ranging from 0 to 14. A pH value of 7 is considered neutral, values below 7 are acidic, and values above 7 are basic. It is based on the concentration of hydrogen ions in the solution."
    ],
    [
        "What is Chemical Equilibrium?",
        "Chemical Equilibrium is a state in a chemical reaction where the rates of the forward and reverse reactions are equal, resulting in no net change in the concentrations of reactants and products over time. It is represented by the equilibrium constant (K)."
    ],
    [
        "Explain Endothermic Reactions.",
        "Endothermic Reactions are chemical reactions that absorb heat energy from the surroundings, resulting in a decrease in temperature. They are characterized by a positive change in enthalpy (∆H) and are often accompanied by feelings of coldness."
    ],
    [
        "Describe Exothermic Reactions.",
        "Exothermic Reactions are chemical reactions that release heat energy into the surroundings, resulting in an increase in temperature. They are characterized by a negative change in enthalpy (∆H) and are often accompanied by feelings of warmth."
    ],
    [
        "What is a Catalyst?",
        "A Catalyst is a substance that increases the rate of a chemical reaction by providing an alternative reaction pathway with lower activation energy. It remains unchanged at the end of the reaction and can be reused."
    ],
    [
        "Explain Enzymes.",
        "Enzymes are biological catalysts that facilitate biochemical reactions in living organisms by lowering the activation energy required for the reactions to occur. They are highly specific and essential for metabolic processes."
    ],
    [
        "Describe the Law of Conservation of Mass.",
        "The Law of Conservation of Mass states that the total mass of substances involved in a chemical reaction remains constant over time; mass is neither created nor destroyed in a chemical reaction, only rearranged."
    ],
    [
        "What is Stoichiometry?",
        "Stoichiometry is the branch of chemistry that deals with the quantitative relationships between reactants and products in chemical reactions. It involves calculations based on the balanced chemical equation."
    ],
    [
        "Explain Avogadro's Law.",
        "Avogadro's Law states that equal volumes of gases at the same temperature and pressure contain equal numbers of molecules. It is based on the concept that gases occupy the same volume under the same conditions."
    ],
    [
        "Describe the Ideal Gas Law.",
        "The Ideal Gas Law, represented by the equation PV = nRT, relates the pressure (P), volume (V), temperature (T), and number of moles (n) of an ideal gas. It combines Boyle's Law, Charles's Law, and Avogadro's Law."
    ],
    [
        "What is a Chemical Formula?",
        "A Chemical Formula is a symbolic representation of the chemical composition of a substance, indicating the types and relative numbers of atoms present in a compound or molecule. It provides valuable information about the elements and their proportions in a compound."
    ],
    [
        "Explain Oxidation and Reduction.",
        "Oxidation is the loss of electrons by a substance, resulting in an increase in its oxidation state, while reduction is the gain of electrons by a substance, leading to a decrease in its oxidation state. Together, they form redox reactions."
    ],
    [
        "Describe Electrolysis.",
        "Electrolysis is a process that uses electrical energy to drive a non-spontaneous chemical reaction, often involving the decomposition of electrolytes into their constituent ions. It is used in various industrial processes and electrolytic cells."
